                        <h2>Terracotta Art</h2>
                        <p>Bishnupur, a municipal town in the modern day Bankura district in West Bengal, was a centre
                            of
                            music,
                            art, and architecture for hundreds of years. Among other things, the town is well-known for
                            its
                            terracotta temples, extensively embellished with carved and moulded terracotta decorations
                            made
                            from
                            the locally available laterite clay. These temples are associated with the Gaudiya Vaishnava
                            faith,
                            dating back to seventeenth century.

                            Apart from its temple architecture, Bishnupur is also well-known for the craftsmanship of
                            its
                            terracotta figurines, pottery, jewellery, and other decorative artefacts. In recent years,
                            artisans
                            from Panchmura, a Bankura town not too far from Bishnupur, have also been churning out
                            thousands
                            of
                            terracotta panels emulating the bas-reliefs of the terracotta temples of Bishnupur. These
                            panels
                            not
                            only serve as mementos and curios for tourists to carry back home, but have also been
                            increasingly
                            used to decorate the facades of newer constructions, both religious and secular (Dasgupta
                            2000).

                        <h2>Baluchari Sarees</h2>
                        <p>Baluchari sarees are a famous textile from Bishnupur, known for their elaborate pallu with
                            mythological scenes and intricate weaving techniques. <br>
                            Baluchari Sari (Bengali: বালুচরী শাড়ি) is a type of sari, a garment worn by women in the
                            Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and Assam and the country of Bangladesh. This
                            particular type of sari originated in West Bengal and is known for depictions of
                            mythological scenes on the anchal of the sari. It used to be produced in Murshidabad but
                            presently Bishnupur and its surrounding areas of West Bengal are the only place where
                            authentic Baluchari saris are produced. It takes approximately one week to produce one such
                            sari.[1][2] In 2011, the Baluchari Sari was granted the status of Geographical Indication
                            for West Bengal in India.[3]

                        <h2>Conch Shell Carvings</h2>
                        <p>Conch shell carving is a traditional craft in Bishnupur, West Bengal, India that's known for
                            its intricate patterns and elegant visual art forms. The craft is practiced by the
                            Shankhakar community, who are traditional artists that often belong to the "Sankha Banik"
                            caste. Carving skills are passed down through generations, and many craftsmen have been
                            recognized for their creative excellence. <br>
                            <h3>The process of carving conch shells involves several steps:</h3>
                            <b>Cleaning:</b> The shells are washed to remove dirt and debris, then ground to remove impurities. <br> <br>
                           <b>Soaking:</b> The shells are soaked in hydrochloric acid to make them whiter and fairer. <br> <br>
                            <b>Carving:</b> The shells are carved using simple tools like chisels, files, hammers, and 
                            grinders. Chisels come in different sizes depending on the pattern's details. <br> <br>
                            <b>Polishing:</b> The shells are filed and polished to give them a lustrous finish. <br><br>

                            Conch shells are important in the Hindu faith and are considered lucky in Hindu mythology. They are used in puja and are associated with the sea, which is thought to enhance travel luck and strengthen long-distance relationships. Conch shells are also used to make a variety of products, including ornaments, trumpets, home goods, and sculptures.
