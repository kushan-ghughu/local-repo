                    <p class="about_temple">
                        It was at Kamarpukur that Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was born in 1836 in a poor Brahmin family.
                        With his advent and on account of the frequent visits of his disciples and devotees, this hamlet
                        has become a place of pilgrimage. Thousands visit it every year from the various parts of the
                        world and get spiritually refreshed and elevated.

                        Through the help of the devotees and the management, and of the monks of the Ramakrishna Math
                        and Ramakrishna Mission, the temple of Bhagavan Sri Ramakrishna, with his marble statue
                        installed in it, was built in 1951 at Kamarpukur. Later developments include the construction of
                        guest houses, a library, a dispensary and schools and the re-excavation of the tank called
                        Haldarpukur.[citation needed]

                        Vishalakshi Temple - Situated at Anur, around 2 km from Kamarpukur, goddess Vishalakshi is a
                        popular deity. People vow offerings to the goddess with the hope that the goddess will fulfil
                        their desire. Not very long ago the goddess resided under the open sky at the place where the
                        present temple is situated. Villagers were used to construct an ordinary leafy shed every year
                        before the Makar Sankranti (Mid-January) when a fair was organised. The tradition of the fair is
                        being followed till today. One anecdote, associated with goddess Vishalakshi, states that
                        Gadadhar (Sri Ramakrishna in his childhood) was accompanying a group of pious ladies in their
                        way to offer worship to goddess Vishalakshi. When he was singing the glory of goddess
                        Vishalakshi, suddenly his body became stiff and tears flowed down his cheeks. Seeing these
                        ladies realised that it might be due to the mystic influence of the goddess on the
                        simple-hearted child. They immediately started praying to goddess Vishalakshi to save Gadadhar.
                        Wonder! Gadadhar woke up with a brightened face.

                        After the birth of Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi, who is worshipped as Holy Mother, the spiritual
                        consort of Sri Ramakrishna, the village began to show signs of prosperity which was not so much
                        in

                        big
                        lake called 'Aher' or 'Mother's Tank' or 'Mayer Dighi'; where the visitors and the village-folks
                        take their bath and get refreshed. It is said that the Holy Mother in her girlhood used to cut
                        grass
                        for cows in neck-deep water from this very tank. At present water is supplied to this reservoir
                        from
                        the river Amodar by means of an electric pump and is used for the irrigation of the surrounding
                        fields.

                        There is another tank called 'Barujjey Pukur' (i.e. Banerji's tank) which lies on the
                        south-eastern
                        corner of this village and is surrounded with palmyra trees.

                        Sri Sarada Devi was born in this village in 1853.[4] This village with its sacred traditions has
                        become a holy place of pilgrimage, particularly among followers of Sri Ramakrishna. On one
                        occasion,
                        the Holy Mother, after touching the dust of this place with her forehead, remarked, One's own
                        mother
                        and the land of birth are even far superior to Heaven.
