            Adi Malla was the founder of the Malla dynasty. Adi Malla ruled in Laugram for 33 years and has been known as the Bagdi Raja. He was succeeded by his son, Jay Malla, who invaded Padampur and captured the fort, then the power-centre. Jay Malla extended his domains and shifted his capital to Bishnupur.

            Bishnupur was ruled under the Gupta period by local Hindu kings who paid tribute to Samudra Gupta.[2][3]
            Following a long period of obscurity, where the land oscillated between being a minor independent
            principality and a vassal state. The land is also called Mallabhum after the Malla rulers of this place. The
            Malla rulers were Vaishnavites and built the famous terracotta temples during the 17th and 18th centuries at
            this place. The legends of Bipodtarini Devi are associated with the Malla Kings of Bishnupur.[4] <br> <br>

            For almost a thousand years it was the capital of the Malla kings of Mallabhum, of which Bankura was a part,
            till their power waned during the times when the Mughal Empire weakened under the last monarchs of the
            dynasty. <br> <br>

            The patronage of Malla king Veer Hambir and his successors Raja Raghunath Singha Dev and Bir Singha Dev made
            Bishnupur one of the principal centres of culture in Bengal. Most of the terracotta temples, for which the
            town is known, were built during this period.
            <br><br>
            Mrinmoyee temple of kings is treated as a valuable historic place.
            <br><br>
            Royal patronage also gave rise to Bishnupur Gharana (school) of Hindustani classical music in late
            18th-century[5] and the Bishnupur school of painting.
            <br><br>
            Since 1997, the temples of Bishnupur is on the UNESCO World Heritage Site's Tentative list.[citation needed]
